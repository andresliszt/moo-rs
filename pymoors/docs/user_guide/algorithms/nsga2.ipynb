    "# NSGA-II\n",
    "\n",
    "NSGA-II is a fast, elitist multiobjective evolutionary algorithm designed to efficiently approximate the Pareto-optimal front. It overcomes several issues found in earlier nondominated sorting approaches by reducing computational complexity, ensuring elitism, and eliminating the need for a sharing parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fast Nondominated Sorting:**\n",
    "  NSGA-II sorts the population based on Pareto dominance with a computational complexity of\n",
    "  $O(MN^2)$, where $M$ is the number of objectives and $N$ is the population size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Elitist Selection:**\n",
    "  The algorithm creates a combined pool of parent and offspring populations. From this pool, the best solutions are chosen based on fitness and diversity. This elitist strategy ensures that the best-found solutions are preserved over generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Crowding Distance for Diversity Maintenance:**\n",
    "  To maintain a diverse Pareto front, NSGA-II computes a *crowding distance* for each individual. For each front, the crowding distance $d_i$ of an individual $i$ is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  d_i = \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\frac{f_{m}^{(i+1)} - f_{m}^{(i-1)}}{f_{m}^{\\max} - f_{m}^{\\min}},\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  where:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $f_{m}^{(i)}$ is the value of the $m$-th objective for the $i$-th individual (after sorting the individuals according to that objective),\n",
    "  - $f_{m}^{\\max}$ and $f_{m}^{\\min}$ are the maximum and minimum values of the $m$-th objective in that front, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"../../images/nsga2_crowding.png\" alt=\"Crowding distance\" width=\"600px\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  Individuals with a **larger crowding distance** are in less crowded regions and are preferred when selecting among solutions with the same non-domination rank, thereby promoting diversity across the Pareto front.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constraint Handling:**\n",
    "  When constraints_fn are present, NSGA-II modifies the selection process:\n",
    "  - **Feasible Solutions First:** Feasible individuals (those satisfying all constraints_fn) are always preferred over infeasible ones.\n",
    "  - **Ranking:** Among feasible solutions, those with a better (i.e., lower) nondominated rank are favored.\n",
    "  - **Crowding Distance:** Finally, if individuals share the same rank, the one with a **larger crowding distance** is selected. This ensures that, within the same rank, solutions from less crowded regions of the objective space are chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ZDT3 Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**ZDT3** is a widely used benchmark in multiobjective optimization, especially for testing evolutionary algorithms. It challenges algorithms with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two Conflicting Objectives:**\n",
    "  - $f_1(\\mathbf{x}) = x_1$\n",
    "  - $f_2(\\mathbf{x}) = g(\\mathbf{x}) \\cdot h(f_1(\\mathbf{x}), g(\\mathbf{x}))$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Auxiliary Functions:**\n",
    "  - $g(\\mathbf{x}) = 1 + \\frac{9}{n-1}\\sum_{i=2}^{n} x_i$\n",
    "  - $h(f_1, g) = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{f_1}{g}} - \\frac{f_1}{g}\\sin(10\\pi f_1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - **Discontinuous Pareto Front:** The optimal solutions are spread over several disconnected segments.\n",
    "  - **Nonconvexity:** The Pareto front is nonconvex, making convergence more challenging.\n",
    "  - **Diversity Maintenance:** The discontinuities force algorithms to preserve a diverse set of solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain:**\n",
    "Each decision variable $x_i$ typically belongs to the interval $[0, 1]$, and the problem is often considered with $n = 30$ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "ZDT3 is ideal for evaluating how well an algorithm can balance convergence toward the Pareto-optimal front while maintaining diversity in the presence of a complex, discontinuous solution landscape.\n",
